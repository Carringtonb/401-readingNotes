# Graphs

* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges. Graphs include
    * Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
    * Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
    * Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
    * Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

* A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

* A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

* A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

* An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

* A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

* An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

* a sparse graph is when there are very few connections. a dense graph is when there are many connections
