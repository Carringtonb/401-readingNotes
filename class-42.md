# Ethics

* *ACM* has created a code of ethics that is composed of several principals. Each principal is supplemented by guidlines which provide an explanation to assist with understanding the principal.

## General Ethical Principals

### Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.

* This principal is about the quality of life of all people and aims to ensure that computing is used for the benefit of society.

### Avoid Harm

* Follow best practices to avoid as much harm as possible and be diligent in reporting observed harm. Also make best efforts to undo and mitgate any harm caused, included unintended harm.

### Be Honest and Trustworthy

* Be honest about your knowledge and skills. Be forthcoming about conflicts of interest and honor commitments.

### Be Fair and Take Action not to Discriminate

* Prejudicial discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity, labor union membership, military status, nationality, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, or any other inappropriate factor is an explicit violation of the Code.

### Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.

* Do not plagiarize other developers work and always give credit when you reference someone elses code base. 

### Respect Privacy

* Technology enables the collection, monitoring, and exchange of personal information quickly, inexpensively, and often without the knowledge of the people affected.

* Because of this it is our responsibility to protect this data and not abuse the collection process.

* Only the minimum amount of personal information necessary should be collected in a system. The retention and disposal periods for that information should be clearly defined, enforced, and communicated to data subjects.

### Honor Confidentiality

* Protect the confidentiality you are entrusted with, unless it is in violation of the ```law.```

## Professional Responsibility

### Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.

* Computing professionals should insist on and support high quality work from themselves and from colleagues. 

### Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.

* Always try to stay improving and learning. Technology changes fast and we need to stay current with our knowledge and ethical practices.

### Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.

* Computing professionals should follow the predefined rules in their area and workplace; unless these rules are unethical, in which case the rules should be challenged.

### Accept and provide appropriate professional review.

* Whenever appropriate, computing professionals should seek and utilize peer and stakeholder review.

### Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.

* Be honest about what we know and what we do not know regarding the risks of machine learning and computing in general.

### Perform work only in areas of competence.

* It is our responibility to disclose any areas where we lack necessary expertise.

### Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.

* Within ones abilities, computing professionals should share technical knowledge and try to better the community.

### Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.

* Do not access other computers software, or data without a reasonable belief that such an action would be authorized or a compelling belief that it is consistent with the public good.

### Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure

* Computing professionals should perform due diligence to ensure the system functions as intended, and take appropriate action to secure resources against accidental and intentional misuse, modification, and denial of service.

## Professional Leadership Principles

### Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.

* The public good should always be an explicit consideration when evaluating tasks associated with research, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, validation, deployment, maintenance, retirement, and disposal.

### Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.

* Leaders should encourage full participation of computing professionals in meeting relevant social responsibilities and discourage tendencies to do otherwise.

### Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.

* Leaders should consider the personal and professional development, accessibility requirements, physical safety, psychological well-being, and human dignity of all workers.

### Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.

* Leaders should pursue clearly defined organizational policies that are consistent with the Code and effectively communicate them to relevant stakeholders.

### Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.

* Leaders should ensure that opportunities are available to computing professionals to help them improve their knowledge and skills in professionalism, in the practice of ethics, and in their technical specialties.

### Use care when modifying or retiring systems.

* Thoroughly investigate viable alternatives to deleting interfaces, when deleting is necessary, users should be notified. 

### Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.

* When organizations and groups develop systems that become an important part of the infrastructure of society, their leaders have an added responsibility to be good stewards of these systems.

## Comnpliance with Code

### Uphold, promote, and respect the principles of the Code.

* Computing professionals should adhere to the principles of the Code and contribute to improving them. 

### Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.

* Each ACM member should encourage and support adherence by all computing professionals regardless of ACM membership.
