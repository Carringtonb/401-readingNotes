# Blob Storage

* Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

* A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name.

* The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account.

* A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.
