# Open Source

* There are tutorials like `hands on` that walk you through how to make open source contributions

* To get started, some Open Source owners will have contributions that are specifically designed for first timers and are generally easier or smaller than other problems.

* In general is good practice and experience to find open source projects and make contributions to them. Occasionally your contribution will be approved and your work noticed. Even if your contributions do not get approved, it is a good way to practice and continue to learn.
