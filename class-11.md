# MVC

* The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern seperates an application into three main groups of components.
    * Model- The model works with the controller to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries.
    * Views - The controoler chooses the view to display to the user.
    * Controllers - User requests are routed to the controller.

* Seperating out responsabilities make scaling an application easier because you can test specific parts.

* The ASP .NET Core MVC framework is a lightweight, open source, highly testable presentation framework optimized for use with ASP.NET Core.

* You can define your applications URL naming patterns to work well for SEO and link generation.

* The framework's use of interfaces and dependency injection make it well-suited to unit testing, and the framework includes features that make integration tests quick and easy as well.
