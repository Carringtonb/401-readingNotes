# Relational Databases

### Characteristics

* Traditionally, data was organized in file formats. DBMS was a new concept then, and all the research was done to make it overcome the deficiencies in traditional style of data management.

*  A database is an active entity, whereas data is said to be passive, on which the database works and organizes.

*  DBMS also stores metadata, which is data about data, to ease its own process.

* A DBMS can provide greater consistency as compared to earlier forms of data storing applications like file-processing systems.

### Query Language 

* DBMS is equipped with query language, which makes it more efficient to retrieve and manipulate data.

* A user can apply as many and as different filtering options as required to retrieve a set of data. Though there are restrictions on transactions when users attempt to handle the same data item, but users are always unaware of them.

### Security 
* Features like multiple views offer security to some extent where users are unable to access data of other users and departments.

* DBMS offers methods to impose constraints while entering data into the database and retrieving the same at a later stage.

### Users

* A typical DBMS has users with different rights and permissions who use it for different purposes. Some users retrieve data and some back it up. 

### Administrators
* Administrators maintain the DBMS and are responsible for administrating the database. 

### Designers 
* Designers are the group of people who actually work on the designing part of the database.

* They keep a close watch on what data should be kept and in what format. 

### End Users 
* End users are those who actually reap the benefits of having a DBMS.
